## Test notes

- I would normally add testing for the bonus task (client-side form validation) but ran out of time.
- Some of the images weren't loading, I would normally add placeholders for these but wasn't sure this was intended.
- I took the vague gherkin statement "Then I am presented with 'results' page" to be open to a little interpretation. e.g. It doesn't say "then I am directed to a `/results` page", so I made a `/search/:postcode` page instead.
- I used CSS grid in places, there wasn't a browser matrix provided so I took the liberty of only supporting the latest browsers.
- I would also have liked to add dynamic page titles for SEO but didn't think this was appropriate for the test.
- I had fun doing this however it did take me more than 1 hour, probably more like 2-3 hours. Mainly because I changed my mind once or twice in considering how the results page routing should work, it might just be me but I would have required more specifics in the BDD on how this would work.
